# EmployME Management System

EmployME Management System is a .NET/React application that allows business owners to track employee data and create job applications.

There are two user interfaces for EmployME. One side is the management system operated by the employer, while the other side is a job board, training center, and document management system for employees. 

This repository is the management system for employers. If you would like to see the other repository for employees, please view [The EmployME Application Center](https://github.com/drg49/EmployME-Application-Center)
